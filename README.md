This is a fork of original JQuery Crosslide plugin which is now deprecated.

Added features:
* Plugin now handles percentage dimensions of the container and adjusts animation
* New option `toggleDir: 'updown'` that will automatically set direction of image so each image would be animated from the opposite direction
* New option `width` to optionally set container width.
